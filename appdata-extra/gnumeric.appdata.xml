The Gnumeric spreadsheet is part of the GNOME desktop environment: a project to
create a free, user friendly desktop environment.
</p>
<p>
The goal of Gnumeric is to be the best possible spreadsheet.
We are not attempting to clone existing applications.
However, Gnumeric can read files saved with other spreadsheets and we offer a
customizable feel that attempts to minimize the costs of transition.
