Ibus-Typing Booster is a predictive input method and predicts complete words
based on partial input.
One can then simply select the desired word from a list of suggestions and
improve one's typing speed and spelling.

Input methods are typing systems allowing users to input complex languages.
They are necessary because these contain too many characters to simply be laid
out on a traditional keyboard.
