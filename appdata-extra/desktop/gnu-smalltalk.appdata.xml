		<p>
			Smalltalk is a dynamic object oriented language from the 80's. There is no primitives types, 
			everything is represented as objects: Types, Methods, Numbers.. Everything. Is very easy to learn if you compare
			with C++ for instance and the code is easy to read, making Smalltalk a good choice for beginners.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can use GNU Smalltalk on any POSIX based SO (including Linux) and Windows.
