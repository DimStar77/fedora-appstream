		<p>
			Flaw is a game where you control a wizard and your goal is to survive as much as you can. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                	In addition to the fireballs that arise increasingly in larger quantities, 
                	there are other wizards trying to kill you.
                </p>
		
		<p>
			The game has some items that give you special abilities to defend yourself or attack your enemies.
		</p>

		<p>
			Flaw can be played on single-player mode or with your friends.
