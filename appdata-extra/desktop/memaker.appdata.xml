 <summary>An avatar creator</summary>
 <description>
  <p>
      MeMaker gives users a wide variety of images that, when placed 
      together, create an avatar. This avatar is intended to represent 
      the way that this person is in some way. The goal of the project 
      is to have enough images that anyone can create an image that 
      they feel would closely represent them without having to use a photo
      in the image itself.
  </p>
  <p>
      MeMaker is a nifty little tool that takes packages of theme avatar 
      features and easily places them together to make an avatar of your 
      liking. Features include Hair, Faces, Eyes, even Glasses and 
      Accessories like hats and earings.
