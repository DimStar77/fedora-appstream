     architecture, making K-3D a versatile and powerful tool for artists.

     K-3D's interface uses your platform's look-and-feel, and it's
     consistent with the applications you already know.
     New artists will find K-3D easy to understand, and professionals
     feel right at home. K-3D is intuitive, consistent, and discoverable.
