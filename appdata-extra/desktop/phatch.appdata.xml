      Phatch (PHoto bATCH Processor) is an application to batch process images.
      With phatch, you specify a group of images that you want to process, and then
      specify the effects you want to apply; once you click apply the process is run
      automatically without having to edit each image individually.
      Phatch has many effects you can apply to your images, including resizing,
      rotating, renaming, colour effects (like desaturation and color warmth),
      drop shadows and adding a background.
