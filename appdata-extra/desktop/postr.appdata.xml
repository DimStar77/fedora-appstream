    <p>
      Postr is a simple application for uploading images from your computer
      to the Flickr image sharing website.
      It has a simple yet powerful user interface that allows you to set
      common attributes for your photos on Flickr like title, description, tags,
      sets, groups, privacy and licence.
      It also has session management, integration with the Nautilus file browser,
      and also supports dragging and dropping files from any file browser.
