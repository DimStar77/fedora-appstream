		<p>
			xzgv is a simple image editor, with a focus on controlling all actions using keyboard input.
			It has a simple, two pane layout, with all the thumbnails of the current directory listed
			in the left pane, and the image viewed in the main pane. The menu in xzgv can be viewed
			in a context menu that is shown by right-clicking on the main image pane. This context
			menu also lists all the keyboard shortcuts if you are new to xzgv and need to know them
