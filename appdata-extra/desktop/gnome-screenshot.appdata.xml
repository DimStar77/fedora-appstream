GNOME Screenshot is a simple utility that lets you take pictures of your computer screen.
Screenshots can be of your whole screen, any specific application, or a selected
rectangular area.
You can also copy the captured screenshot directly into the GNOME clipboard and
paste it into other applications.
</p>
<p>
GNOME Screenshot allows you to take screenshots even when it's not open: just
press the PrtSc button on your keyboard, and a snapshot of your whole screen will
be saved to your Pictures folder.
Hold Alt while pressing PrtSc and you will get a screenshot of only the currently
selected window.
