      Freeciv is a free turn-based multiplayer strategy game, in which each player
      becomes the leader of a civilization, fighting to obtain the ultimate goal:
      To become the greatest civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players of the Civilization® series by Microprose® should feel at home,
      since one aim of Freeciv is to have optional modes (called rulesets) with
      compatible rules.
    </p>
    <p>
    Freeciv is maintained by an international team of coders and enthusiasts,
    and is easily one of the most fun and addictive network games out there!
    </p>
    <p>
    That also means it has very extensive multilanguage support, something rare
    in games.
