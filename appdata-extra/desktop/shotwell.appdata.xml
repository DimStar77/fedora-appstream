      Shotwell is an easy-to-use, fast photo organizer.
      After importing photos from your camera, it lets you sort them by tag,
      rating, or date.
      Shotwell also allows you to do small edits, like correcting red eyes or
      adjusting contrast.

      If you wish, Shotwell can also upload your photos to sharing web sites
      such as Flickr, Facebook, or Picasa.
