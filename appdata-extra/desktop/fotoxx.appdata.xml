<p>
  Fotoxx is a photo collection managment application that allows you to import photos from
  either your digital camera, or from your computer. Once imported, the photos are presented
  in thumbnail views of varying sizes or a single image view that allows you to then view the
  next image. Fotoxx also has a wide range of photo correction and manipulation features,
  including: tweaking brightness, color and contrast, rotating and skewing, and other image 
  effects like embossing and HDR effects.
