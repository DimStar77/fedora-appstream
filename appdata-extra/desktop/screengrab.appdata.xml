      Screengrab is a utility to take screenshots of your desktop.
      With Screengrab you can take a shot of your whole desktop, a specific window,
      or you can select the area you want to capture by dragging a rectangle with the mouse.
      Additionally it features the ability to copy the screenshot to the clipboard,
      set a delay before the screenshot is taken and save with filenames
      containing the current date and time.
