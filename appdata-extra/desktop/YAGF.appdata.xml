<p>
  YAGF is an application that can convert an image to text using optical character recognition (OCR).
  You can scan directly from a scanner, or import a previously scanned image or PDF file, and convert 
  it to text output. YAGF has two different OCR engines to choose from: Cuneform and Tesseract, so if
  your results are not suitable with one engine, you can use the other.
