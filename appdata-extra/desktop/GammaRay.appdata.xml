     GammaRay is a tool for examining the internals of a Qt application
     and to some extent also manipulate it.
     GammaRay uses injection methods to hook into an application at
     runtime and provide access to a wide variety of interesting information.
     It provides easy ways of navigating through the complex internal
     structures you find in some Qt frameworks, such as QGraphicsView,
     model/view, QTextDocument, state machines and more.

    <p>
     GammaRay augments your conventional debugger by providing
     domain-specific debugging aids on a much higher level.
     It provides easy ways of navigating through the complex internal
     structures you find in some Qt frameworks, such as QGraphicsView,
     model/view, QTextDocument, state machines and more.
     Unlike the debugger, GammaRay understands those internal structures
     and can present them in a meaningful way.
     GammaRay should not be missing in any Qt developerâ€™s toolbox.
     GammaRay is available both stand-alone and integrated in Qt Creator
     and allows both inspection of Qt applications right from the start
     as well as attaching to a running Qt application later on.
