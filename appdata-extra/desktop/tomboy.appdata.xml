      Tomboy is a desktop note-taking application for GNU/Linux, Unix, Windows, and
      Mac OS X.
      Simple and easy to use, but with potential to help you organize the ideas and
      information you deal with every day.

    <p>
      Have you ever felt the frustration at not being able to locate a website you
      wanted to check out, or find an email you found interesting, or remember an idea
      about the direction of the political landscape in post-industrial Australia?
      Or are you one of those desperate souls with home-made, buggy, or not-quite-perfect
      notes systems?
      Time for Tomboy.
    </p>
    <p>
      We bet you'll be surprised at how well a little application can make life less
      cluttered and run more smoothly.
