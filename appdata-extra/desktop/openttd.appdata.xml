      OpenTTD is a transport tycoon simulation game that enhances the
      original Transport Tycoon game developed by Chris Sawyer.
      The game includes road, air, train and naval transport with a large
      selection of industries and passenger services that need to be provided.

      The game can be played in both single and multiplayer modes where
      you compete with other transport companies to dominate the markets.
