    <p>
      GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended for
      numerical computations.
      It provides capabilities for the numerical solution of linear and
      nonlinear problems, and for performing other numerical experiments.
      It also provides extensive graphics capabilities for data visualization
      and manipulation.

    <p>
      Octave is normally used through its interactive command line interface,
      but it can also be used to write non-interactive programs.
      The Octave language is quite similar to Matlab so that most programs are
      easily portable.
