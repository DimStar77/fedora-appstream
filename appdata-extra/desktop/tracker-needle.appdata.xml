			Tracker Needle is an application that allows you to search for 
			files, applications and more on your desktop. It uses Tracker
			as a backend that constantly tracks file changes on your computer
			to provide fast search results. In addition to showing File matches
			Tracker Needle also shows applications that are installed and provides
			the ability to tag files.
