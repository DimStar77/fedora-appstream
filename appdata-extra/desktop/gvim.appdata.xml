     Vim is an advanced text editor that seeks to provide the power of the
     de-facto Unix editor 'Vi', with a more complete feature set.
     It's useful whether you're already using vi or using a different editor.

     Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text
     editing.
     Vim is often called a "programmer's editor," and so useful for programming
     that many consider it an entire IDE. It's not just for programmers, though.
     Vim is perfect for all kinds of text editing, from composing email to
     editing configuration files.
