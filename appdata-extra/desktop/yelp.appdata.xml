      Yelp is a viewer and framework for documentation on the Linux desktop.
      It is used heavily by the GNOME desktop environment, and its tools serve as
      the reference implementation for the Mallard help format.
      Yelp supports DocBook, Mallard, HTML, man, and info documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yelp development has led to the development of various tools, and the Mallard
      and DocBook transformations live in standalone XSLT module.
      All of these are under the umbrella name Yelp.
