        <p>
            Extreme Tux Racer is a downhill racing game starring Tux, the Linux
            penguin. Tux must slide on his belly down snow and ice covered hills,
            collecting herring, and making it to the finish line before the time is
            up. ETR is based on PlanetPenguin Racer, which is in turn based on the
            famous Tux Racer.
