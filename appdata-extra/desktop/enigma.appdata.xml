    <p>
      Enigma is a puzzle game where the player controls a marble with their
      mouse to uncover matching sets of stones.
      While Enigma starts out simply, soon you will enounter a wide range of
      mazes, lazers and traps to stop you from your goal of matching stones.
      Enigma also features a large number
      of user-contributed levels that can also be downloaded from the internet.
