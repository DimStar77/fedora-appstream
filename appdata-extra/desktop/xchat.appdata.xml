  <summary>An IRC Client</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      XChat is an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client.
      It allows you to join multiple IRC channels at the same time, which you can view
      and browse using tabs or a tree-like interface.
      You can use XChat to publicly chat with people in a channel, and to have private
      one-on-one conversations.
      You can even transfer files with XChat!
    </p>
    <p>
      The client includes nick completion, alerts for mentions, logging functionality,
      and several customization options for fonts, sounds and colors.
