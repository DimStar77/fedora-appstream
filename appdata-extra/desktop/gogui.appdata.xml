  <summary>Play the Go board game</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      GoGui lets you play the game of Go, a board game with simple rules but
      very many possible strategies.
      Players take it in turns to capture territory and surround stones placed
      by their opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can play against the computer by installing a program such as GNU Go
      (gnugo) and configuring GoGui to use it for one of the players.
    </p>
    <p>
      Games can be loaded and saved, or set up in specific positions.
