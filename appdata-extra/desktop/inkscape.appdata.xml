<p>
An Open Source vector graphics editor, with capabilities similar to Illustrator,
CorelDraw, or Xara X, using the W3C standard Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file
format.
</p>
<p>
Inkscape supports many advanced SVG features (markers, clones, alpha blending,
etc.) and great care is taken in designing a streamlined interface. It is very
easy to edit nodes, perform complex path operations, trace bitmaps and much more.
We also aim to maintain a thriving user and developer community by using open,
community-oriented development.
