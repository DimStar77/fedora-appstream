		<p>
			Globulation 2 is a real time strategy (RTS) game where you use three types of globs:
			workers, scouts, and warriors to wage war on computer controlled communites of other
			globs. Globulation is unique from other RTS games in that it removes a lot of the 
			micromanagement from the gameplay. You cannot control the globs directly, only place
			buildings and let the globs do what they do best.
