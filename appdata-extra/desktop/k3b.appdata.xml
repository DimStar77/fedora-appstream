      application.It consists of basicly three parts:

    <p>
      The projects: Projects are created from the file menu and then filled with
      data to burn.
      The Tools: The tools menu offers different tools like CD copy or DVD
      formatting.
      Context sensitive media actions: When clicking on the Icon representing a
      CD/DVD drive K3b will present it's contents and allow some further action.
      This is for example the way to rip audio CDs.
