  <p>
  "Cube" (CUBE Uniform Behavioral Encoding) is a presentation
component suitable for displaying a wide variety of performance
data for parallel programs including MPI and OpenMP applications.
</p>
<p>
Program performance is represented in a multi-dimensional space including various program and
system resources. The tool allows the interactive exploration of this
space in a scalable fashion and browsing the different kinds of
performance behavior with ease.  All metrics are uniformly accommodated in the 
same display and thus provide the ability to easily compare the effects of 
different kinds of program behavior.
</p>
<p>
"Cube" also includes a library to
read and write performance data as well as operators to compare,
integrate, and summarize data from different experiments. 
</p>
<p>
The Cube 4.x release series uses an incompatible API and
file format compared to previous versions, however,
existing files in CUBE3 format can still be processed
for backwards-compatibility.
