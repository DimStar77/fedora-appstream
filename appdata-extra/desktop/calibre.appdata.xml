Calibre is meant to be a complete e-library solution. It includes library
management, format conversion, news feeds to e-book conversion as well as
e-book reader sync features.
</p>
<p>
Calibre is primarily an e-book cataloging program. It manages your e-book
collection for you. It is designed around the concept of the logical book,
i.e. a single entry in the database that may correspond to e-books in several
formats. It also supports conversion from a dozen different e-book formats to
LRF and EPUB. A graphical interface to the conversion software can be
accessed easily by just clicking the "Convert E-books" button.
</p>
<p>
Calibre has also a built-in e-book viewer that can display all the major e-book
formats.
