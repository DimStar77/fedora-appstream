      Glade is a tool providing quick and easy development of user interfaces for the
      GTK+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The user interfaces designed in Glade are saved as XML, and can be loaded
      dynamically into applications by using GtkBuilder.
      Those files can be used in many programming languages including C, C++, C#, Vala,
      Java, Perl, Python, and others.
      Glade's ability to connect widget signals with corresponding functions makes the
      integration of user interfaces into code even simpler.
