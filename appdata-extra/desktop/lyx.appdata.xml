  <summary>An advanced document processor with the power of LaTeX.</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing based
      on the structure of your documents (WYSIWYM) and not simply their
      appearance (WYSIWYG).
    </p>
    <p>
      LyX combines the power and flexibility of TeX/LaTeX with the ease of use
      of a graphical interface.
      This results in world-class support for creation of mathematical content
      (via a fully integrated equation editor) and structured documents like
      academic articles, theses, and books.
      In addition, staples of scientific authoring such as reference list and
      index creation come standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use LyX to create a letter or a novel or a theatre play or
      film script.
      A broad array of ready, well-designed document layouts are built in.
      LyX is for people who want their writing to look great, right out of the
      box.
      No more endless tinkering with formatting details, “finger painting”
      font attributes or futzing around with page boundaries.
      You just write.
    </p>
