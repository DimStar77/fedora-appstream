      Hitori is a Japanese puzzle game, which is being played with a square grid
      where each cell contains a number.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is to highlight every number so that the following rules apply:
      In each row respectively each column, there's only one number that's not
      highlighted.
      Highlighted cells may not be adjacent and all white fields must be
      connected via at least one of their sides.
