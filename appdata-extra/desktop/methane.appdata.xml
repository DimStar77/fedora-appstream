  <summary>Platform Arcade Game similar to Bubble Bubble</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      Super Methane Brothers is a platform arcade game Puff and Blow each have a
      Methane Gas Gun which fires a cloud of immobilising gas.
      If this comes into contact with a bad guy, he will be absorbed into the gas
      and then float around the screen for a limited time.
      Bad guys are harmless in this state.
      Puff and Blow must suck the floating gas clouds into their guns and blast
      them out against a vertical surface.
      bThe Bad guys then turn into bonuses which can be collected.
