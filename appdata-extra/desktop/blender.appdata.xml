      Blender provides a broad spectrum of modeling, texturing, lighting,
      animation and video post-processing functionality in one package.
      Through its open architecture, Blender provides cross-platform
      interoperability, extensibility, an incredibly small footprint, and a
      tightly integrated workflow.
      Blender is one of the most popular Open Source 3D graphics applications in
      the world.

      Aimed at media professionals and artists world-wide, Blender can be used
      to create 3D visualizations and still images, as well as broadcast- and
      cinema-quality videos, while the incorporation of a real-time 3D engine
      allows for the creation of 3D interactive content for stand-alone
      playback.
