  <summary>View 3D Mandelbrot fractals</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      Mandelbulber is an application for generating, rendering and viewing
      3D Mandelbrot fractals.
      It supports the generation of many different 3D Fractals, including
      Mandelbulb, Menger Sponge, BulbBox, Quaternion and Hypercomplex fractal
      systems.
      It has an extensive user interface for tweaking the variables of your
      fractals, and then renders your fractal in a seperate window where you can
      pan and zoom in on your mathmatical creation.
      Mandelbulber also has the ability to specify a camera, camerapath and
      keyframes to render a fly-through style video of your fractal creation.
