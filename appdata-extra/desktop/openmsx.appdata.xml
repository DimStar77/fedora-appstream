  <description>
    <p>
      MSX is an old Z80-based family of home computers as an attempt to establish
      a single standard in home computing similar to VHS in video.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MSX standard died from year 1988.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MSX standard has been designed by a company called ASCII in Cooperation
      with Microsoft which has provided a firmware version of his extended BASIC
      (called "MicroSoft eXtended BASIC") for the machine, which explains the MSX name.
