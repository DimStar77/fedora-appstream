<p>
The Chewing input method is designed for entering Traditional Chinese text.
Chewing helps you inputting Traditional Chinese by its pronunciation, in the
form of either Bopomofo/Zhuyin or Hanyu pinyin, as well as Chinese punctuation
marks and normal and full shape number and English alphabets.

Input methods are typing systems allowing users to input complex languages.
They are necessary because these contain too many characters to simply be laid
out on a traditional keyboard.
