<p>
A simple GNOME 3 application to access remote or virtual systems.
While virt-manager does a very good job as a virtual machine management software,
its very much tailored for system administration and virtual machines.
</p>
<p>
Boxes on the other hand is targeted towards typical desktop end-user who either
just want a very safe and easy way to try out new operating systems or new
(potentially unstable) versions of her/his favorite operating system(s), or need
to connect to a remote machine (home-office connection being a typical use-case).
For this reason, Boxes will not provide many of the advanced options to tweak
virtual machines provided by virt-manager.
Instead Boxes will focus on getting things working out of the box with very
little input from user.
