Shutter is a feature-rich screenshot program. You can take a screenshot of a specific area, window, your whole screen, or even of a website - apply different effects to it, draw on it to highlight points, and then upload to an image hosting site, all within one window. Shutter is free, open-source, and licensed under GPL v3.

Shutter allows you to capture nearly anything on your screen without losing control over your screenshots (tabbed interface). You don't need to open an external graphics editor like GIMP, because Shutter ships with its own built-in editor.
