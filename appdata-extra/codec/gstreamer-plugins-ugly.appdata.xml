    <p>
      This addon includes several good quality codecs that are well tested.
      These codecs can be used to encode and decode media files where the
      format is not patent encumbered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some important issues with this addon.
      The codecs are not 100% compatible with the license used by the media
      framework used on this system.
      There may also be possible licensing issues with several codecs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A codec decodes audio and video for for playback or editing and is also
      used for transmission or storage.
      Different codecs are used in video-conferencing, streaming media and
      video editing applications.
