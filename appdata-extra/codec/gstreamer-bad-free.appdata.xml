      This addon includes several poor quality codecs that are missing
      something - perhaps a good code review, some documentation, a set of
      tests, a real live maintainer, or some actual wide use.
      However, they might be good enough to play your media files.
    </p>
    <p>
      These codecs can be used to encode and decode media files where the
      format is not patent encumbered.

      A codec decodes audio and video for for playback or editing and is also
      used for transmission or storage.
      Different codecs are used in video-conferencing, streaming media and
      video editing applications.
