<p>
Quick (also known as “Simplified Cangjie”) is a radical-based input method,
designed to input both Traditional and Simplified Chinese, as well as Japanese.
</p>
<p>
As it is rarely used outside of Hong Kong (where it is one of the two most used
input methods), we strive to provide the best input experience for people of
the SAR by default, but provide useful options for others.

<p>
Input methods are typing systems allowing users to input complex languages.
They are necessary because these contain too many characters to simply be laid
out on a traditional keyboard.
